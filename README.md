# SIG: Linked Data

The files in this repository are used by the SIG Linked Data. One of the goals of the group is to apply Linked Data on the www.taxonic.com website. Applying Linked Data on the website consists of several steps:
  + Semantic modelling: creating a conceptual model.
  + Retrieving the data: creating a web scraper.
  + Transforming the data from json to rdf: creating a RML Mapping.
  + Validating the RDF graph: creating a shapes graph.
  + Storing the data in a triplestore in order to access them with a SPARQL endpoint.
